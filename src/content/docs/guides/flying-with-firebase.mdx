import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import Highlight from '../../../directives/highlight.astro';

Now that we have an amazing application created, we will use Firebase for working with a database, and to host our application.
The final application is deployed at the moment here (link to be added).

## Setup Firebase

Start with creating a firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com). The setup process is a breeze.

### Enable Firestore Database

From the left menu, click `Build` and the `Firestore Database` to go to the database dashboard. Click the `Create Database` button and start the database in `test mode`.

:::note
You can change the firestore rules to `production` settings when you are releasing your applications to end-users.
:::

Choose the Firestore location and we're good to go.

## Set up Hosting

From the left menu, click `Build` and the `Hosting` to go to the hosting dashboard. Click the `Get started` to start the process.

The process will tell you to run `npm install -g firebase-tools`. You can open your terminal (being in any folder) and run this command. 

After that, sign into your google account using `firebase login`. **You don't ‚ùå need to** run `firebase init` or `firebase deploy`. We'll handle that later in the process.

## Add `@angular/fire` to the project

Since we have an official node package for firebase from the Angular team, we will use it as it works seamlessly with Angular (almost). 

The version of `@angular/fire` (v7.6.1) at the time of writing this workshop does not work with Standalone components. So we will have to do a quick work around. Start by creating an angular module as follows:

```bash
ng g m app --path src
```

Now run the following command to add `@angular/fire` to our Angular application:
```bash
ng add @angular/fire
```

When asked, choose both `ng deploy --hosting` and `Firestore` as features to use as follows:
```bash
‚óâ ng deploy -- hosting
‚óØ Authentication
‚óâ Firestore
```

Choose your account that's already logged in. Then choose the application you just created at https://console.firebase.google.com. In our case, that should probably be `ng-flight-scanner`. It should also show an existing firebase site to choose for hosting, choose that. 

When it asks for an app, if you don't see any name, just select `CREATE NEW APP` and give it the name `ng-flight-scanner-web`.

You should see the following output at the end of this process:

```bash
CREATE src/environments/environment.ts (359 bytes)
CREATE .firebaserc (227 bytes)
UPDATE .gitignore (602 bytes)
UPDATE src/app/app.module.ts (502 bytes)
UPDATE angular.json (3322 bytes)
UPDATE firebase.json (122 bytes)
```

Now, since the `app.module.ts` was a workaround, we need to add AngularFire properly in our application. To do so, we will update our `app.config.ts` file as follows:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="app.config.ts">
  ```ts
  hlconfig 1,5-7,13-16
  import { ApplicationConfig, importProvidersFrom } from '@angular/core';
  import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';
  import { provideHttpClient, withFetch } from '@angular/common/http'; 
  import { routes } from './app.routes';
  import { initializeApp, provideFirebaseApp } from '@angular/fire/app';
  import { environment } from 'src/environments/environment';
  import { getFirestore, provideFirestore } from '@angular/fire/firestore';

  export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [
      provideRouter(routes),
      provideHttpClient(withFetch()),
      importProvidersFrom(
        provideFirebaseApp(() => initializeApp(environment.firebase)),
        provideFirestore(() => getFirestore())
      )
    ]
  };

  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
Note that we're using `environment.firebase` as an argument to the `initializeApp` method. If you go to the `environment.ts` file, you should be able to see the entire firebase configuration. Ideally, this should not be pushed to github or any public repostory and should rather be defined in an environment variable. For the sake of keeping this workshop simpler, we're not covering it today.
:::

You might see the follwing error on console. This is due to an incompatible `rxfire` version at the moment.
```bash
Error: node_modules/rxfire/firestore/lite/interfaces.d.ts:8:29 - error TS2314: Generic type 'AggregateQuerySnapshot<T>' requires 1 type argument(s).

 8 export type CountSnapshot = lite.AggregateQuerySnapshot<{
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 9     count: lite.AggregateField<number>;
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
10 }, any, DocumentData>;
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **

‚úñ Failed to compile.
```

To fix this, run this command from a terminal in your project:
```bash
npm install rxfire@6.0.4 firebase@9.23.0
```

This will resolve the issue and our app should be compiled successfully. Great!

You can now delete ‚ùå the `app.module.ts` since we don't need it anymore.

## Favorite Flights with Firestore

To mark the flights as favorite or not, we will use Firestore to just keep the IDs of the favorite flights since we don't want to duplicate the flights data.
This is how the psuedo code looks like for the favorite flights functionality:
```text
- Get all favorite flights from firestore
-- create an `favoriteFlights` object (key - value pair) locally to store those IDs for easy access
- For each filtered flight component on the screen, see if the `favoriteFlights` object contains the flight's IDs
-- If it does contain the flight ID, show a heart icon on the right side of the flight card to indicate it as favorite.
```

Let's start with updating the home component to inject the Firestore service as folows:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="home.component.ts">
  ```ts
  hlconfig 6,18
  import { Component, OnInit, Signal, computed, inject, signal } from '@angular/core';
  import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
  import { FlightService } from '../services/flight.service';
  import { IFlight } from '../types';
  import { FlightCardComponent } from '../components/flight-card/flight-card.component';
  import { Firestore } from '@angular/fire/firestore';

  @Component({
    // ...1
  })
  export class HomeComponent implements OnInit {
    flightService = inject(FlightService);
    flights = signal<IFlight[]>([]);
    filteredFlights: Signal<IFlight[]> = computed(() => {
      // ...
    });

    firestore = inject(Firestore);
    favoriteFlights = signal<Record<string, boolean>>({});

    // ...
  }

  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now we will add a function to mark/unmark a flight as favorite. For this, we will create a `Record<string, string>` to keep
all the favorited flight ids in the Record so we can reference that in the template. This is much performant for our use case
compared to having an array of favorited flights, or even an array of IDs of the flights.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="home.component.ts">
  ```ts
  hlconfig 3,4,17,27-47
  // ...
  import { FlightCardComponent } from '../components/flight-card/flight-card.component';
  import { Firestore, doc, getDoc, setDoc } from '@angular/fire/firestore';
  import { deleteDoc } from 'firebase/firestore';

  @Component({
    // ...
  })
  export class HomeComponent implements OnInit {
    flightService = inject(FlightService);
    flights = signal<IFlight[]>([]);
    filteredFlights: Signal<IFlight[]> = computed(() => {
      // ...
    });

    firestore = inject(Firestore);
    favoriteFlights = signal<Record<string, boolean>>({});

    isMatchingFlight(searchTerm: string, flight: IFlight) {
      // ...
    }

    ngOnInit(): void {
      // ...
    }

    async toggleFlightAsFavorite(flight: IFlight) {
      const docRef = doc(this.firestore, `favorites/${flight.id}`)
      const document = await getDoc(docRef);
      const favFlights = {
        ...this.favoriteFlights()
      }
      if (document.exists()) {
        await deleteDoc(docRef);
        delete favFlights[flight.id];
      } else {
        /**
         * We are just adding the `id` of the flight in firestore,
         * feel free to add more properties
         */
        setDoc(docRef, {
          id: flight.id
        });
        favFlights[flight.id] = true;
      }
      this.favoriteFlights.set({ ...favFlights });
    }
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="home.component.html">
  ```html
  hlconfig 3-7
  <div class="container">
    <section class="flex flex-col gap-8">
      <app-flight-card (click)="toggleFlightAsFavorite(flight)" *ngFor="let flight of filteredFlights()" [flightItem]="flight">
        <svg *ngIf="favoriteFlights()[flight.id]" width="24" height="24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd">
          <path d="M12 21.593c-5.63-5.539-11-10.297-11-14.402 0-3.791 3.068-5.191 5.281-5.191 1.312 0 4.151.501 5.719 4.457 1.59-3.968 4.464-4.447 5.726-4.447 2.54 0 5.274 1.621 5.274 5.181 0 4.069-5.136 8.625-11 14.402m5.726-20.583c-2.203 0-4.446 1.042-5.726 3.238-1.285-2.206-3.522-3.248-5.719-3.248-3.183 0-6.281 2.187-6.281 6.191 0 4.661 5.571 9.429 12 15.809 6.43-6.38 12-11.148 12-15.809 0-4.011-3.095-6.181-6.274-6.181"/>
        </svg>
      </app-flight-card>
    </section>
  </div>

  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

With the above changes, if you click any flight card, you should be able to see them marked as favorited having a heart icon on the right side of the card.
And if you click the card again, you can see it being unmarked as favorite. And you can inspect the `toggleFlightAsFavorite()` method to see the implementation.
Notice how we're creating a shallow copy of the `this.favoriteFlights` signal's value into a local `favFlights` object to update the object manually after
marking or unmarking as favorite. This will change in a later step.

:::tip
As you mark/unmark a flight as favorite, check the firestore database to see the documents being created and deleted from it.
:::

There is one issue at the moment ‚ö†Ô∏è. And that is if you refresh the page, you can not see your favorited flights anymore. However, since they are already
in the database, if you try to mark an existing marked flight, you will see no change on the flight card (since it is already marked) and if you click it one
more time, then you can see the change. To fix this, we will get the favorited flights from firebase on page load. Update the home component files as follows:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="home.component.ts">
  ```ts
  hlconfig 3,29-36,39-54
  // ...
  import { FlightCardComponent } from '../components/flight-card/flight-card.component';
  import { Firestore, collection, collectionData, doc, getDoc, setDoc } from '@angular/fire/firestore';
  import { deleteDoc } from 'firebase/firestore';

  @Component({
    // ...
  })
  export class HomeComponent implements OnInit {
    flightService = inject(FlightService);
    flights = signal<IFlight[]>([]);
    filteredFlights: Signal<IFlight[]> = computed(() => {
      // ...
    });

    firestore = inject(Firestore);
    favoriteFlights = signal<Record<string, boolean>>({});

    isMatchingFlight(searchTerm: string, flight: IFlight) {
      // ...
    }

    ngOnInit(): void {
      this.flightService.getData()
        .subscribe({
          // ...
        });

      collectionData(collection(this.firestore, 'favorites'))
        .subscribe((data) => {
          const favFlights: Record<string, boolean> = {};
          data.forEach(doc => {
            favFlights[(doc as IFlight).id] = true;
          })
          this.favoriteFlights.set(favFlights);
        })
    }

    async toggleFlightAsFavorite(flight: IFlight) {
      const docRef = doc(this.firestore, `favorites/${flight.id}`)
      const document = await getDoc(docRef);
      if (document.exists()) {
        await deleteDoc(docRef);
      } else {
        /**
        * We are just adding the `id` of the flight in firestore,
        * feel free to add more properties
        */
        setDoc(docRef, {
          id: flight.id
        });
      }
      this.favoriteFlights.set({ ...favFlights });
    }
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
Note that we've modified the `toggleFlightAsFavorite` function as well to remove manually updating the `this.favoriteFlights` signal
as we now are listening to the `collectionData` which automatically updates the signal for us.
:::

With the above change, you can now mark/unmark flights as favorite, and even if you refresh the page, you will still see them as favorited as
we load the favorited flights from Firestore on page load.

Yayy üéâ You've successfully build your first Angular application with HTTP calls, Signals, and Firebase Firestore.


## Deploying the app

It is now time to deploy the application. Run the following command to deploy the Angular app.


```bash
ng deploy
```

You should be able to see the logs for the Angular app being build and deployed as follows:
```bash
=== Deploying to 'ng-flight-scanner'...
