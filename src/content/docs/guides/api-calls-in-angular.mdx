description: Using the HTTPClient to make API calls in Angular

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Creating our first Angular Service

To make API calls in our Angular application, we will create an Angular Service because this is a prominent practice to keep the HTTP calls inside Angular Services.

We will create our first Angular service by running the following command in the terminal.

```bash
ng g s services/flight
```

## Providing the HTTPClient APIs to the Standalone Angular App

This creates the `FlightService` in the above mentioned folder. Before we can make HTTP calls in a Standalone Components based application, we need to provide the HTTPClient APIs to the application in the `app.config.ts` file as follows:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="src/app/app.config.ts">
  ```ts
  import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core';
  import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';
  import { provideHttpClient, withFetch } from '@angular/common/http';  /* 👈🏽 add this */
  import { routes } from './app.routes';

  export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [
      provideRouter(routes),
      provideHttpClient(withFetch()), /* 👈🏽 add this */
    ]
  };
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Using the FlightService to make HTTP calls

First, let's understand that we will work with [some JSON data](/data.json). Since the data is generated from a nice package called `@ngneat/falso`, we're going to install it to be able to use the built-in types from it.
Install the package as follows:

```bash
npm install --save @ngneat/falso
```

We will create an `interface` for the data type we're going to use. I.e. for flights. Let's create a new file inside our `src/app` folder and name it `types-and-interfaces.ts`. Then add the following code to it:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="src/app/types.ts">
  ```ts
  import { FlightDetails } from "@ngneat/falso";
  import { Airline } from "@ngneat/falso/src/lib/flight-number";

  export type IAirline = {
    id: string;
    name: Airline;
  }

  export type IFlight = {
    id: string;
    details: FlightDetails & {
      image: string
    }
  }

  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now that we have the types

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="src/app/services/flight.service.ts">
  ```ts
  import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; /* 👈🏽 add this */
  import { Injectable, inject /* 👈🏽 add this */ } from '@angular/core';
  import { IAirline, IFlight } from '../types'; /* 👈🏽 add this */

  @Injectable({
    providedIn: 'root'
  })
  export class FlightService {
    http = inject(HttpClient); /* 👈🏽 add this */

    getData() {  /* 👈🏽 add this */
      return this.http.get<{
        AIRLINES: IAirline[],
        FLIGHTS: IFlight[]
      }>('WORKSHOP_GITHUB_REPO/public/data.json')
    }
  }

  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
